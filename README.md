### TODO

Server side

-   If Timeout error still return those results that have been successful

Table sorting

-   Headings on two lines without messing everything else up (heading and aria-label)
-   null values to = 1000, when sorted set these to 1000 or -1000 depending on whether sorting from high to low
-   select 1000 values and style them so they can't be seen
